**Challenge**

Today's biggest challenge regarded the setup and cofiguration of webpack, which is needed to compile the react .jsx files. To integrate it with the compiler, Babel, I needed to create custom configuration files for both webpack and babel.

**Action**

The configuration file needed the entry to point to the index.jsx and the bundled file to be created in the folder that I am statically serving up in the express server.

Next I needed to install npm packages for a babel syntax module and babel-loader, adding a module rule to instuct webpack to use the babel-loader when it compiles .jsx files.

I then did the same for css, adding an npm package for css-loader and adding a rule to the webpack config so that it would use that when encountering css files.
